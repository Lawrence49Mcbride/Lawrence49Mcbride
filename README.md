## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a backend engineer with a strong focus on building reliable, high-performance systems using Golang. My primary area of expertise lies in designing and implementing microservices architectures that are scalable, maintainable, and built for real-world production environments. This repository is a collection of personal projects, utilities, and experiments that reflect my journey and growth as an engineer.

Golang has been my go-to language for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong concurrency supportâ€”making it ideal for developing services that handle heavy workloads and real-time data processing. I enjoy working through the complexities of distributed systems and solving problems related to service communication, data consistency, and fault tolerance.

I also have hands-on experience with Kubernetes, using it to orchestrate and manage containerized applications across environments. From writing Helm charts to managing deployments and autoscaling strategies, I take pride in ensuring that the systems I build are not only robust but also production-ready. CI/CD, observability (with tools like Prometheus and Grafana), and containerization with Docker are also part of my workflow.

This repository features a variety of backend-focused projectsâ€”ranging from RESTful services and internal tooling to architecture blueprints and Kubernetes deployment setups. Whether you're here to learn, get inspired, or collaborate, I hope these projects provide insight into my approach to backend development and infrastructure engineering.

Feel free to explore the code, open issues, or contribute. I'm always excited to connect with other developers, exchange ideas, and improve through shared knowledge and collaboration.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and stay tuned for more backend tools, patterns, and microservices projects built with Go and powered by Kubernetes.
